1) a calendar month supplied from command line
2) A calendar 1 month before the command line suppled month
3) A calendar 1 month after the command line suppled month
in a file mymonths.txt in your home folder


For example 
If i am going to write a command
echo "12 2017" | calmagic
It should print the 11th month of 2017, 12th month of 2017 and 1st month of 2018 in a file mymonths.txt

1) Refer man cal
2) You need to put your alias in a file .bahs_aliases. and relaunch the terminal window
3) See how to create aliases in linux 
4) Try it on Ubuntu machine.
